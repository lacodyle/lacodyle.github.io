<br>
Analysis of Obesity Levels including cluster analysis for data exploration, classification, and feature selection to analyze a dataset containing obesity levels among adults from Mexico, Peru, and Columbia and determine which specific eating habits or daily activities most affect the classification of obesity levels. <br><br>

#### Classifying Wild Edible Flowers by Color Segmentation and Histogram of Oriented Gradients
<i>Analyzed in MATLAB for CSC481: Intro to Image Processing at DPU </i> | 
     November 2021<br>

<br>
This analysis explroes the extraction of texture features using histogram of gradients (HOG) for classification of images of wild edible flowers
using support vector machines (SVM). The preprocessing involves color segmentation and compares different HOG parameter sizes as well as different
flower class sizes to determine the most optimal parameters for model performance. <br><br>
