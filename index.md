#### Automotive and Semiconductor Supply Chain Analysis in the United States and South Korea
<i>Analyzed in Python for DSKUS Global Lab: Global Data Science Exchange Program </i> | 
     June 2022<br>

<br>
Investigated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chain by examining trade, production, and manufacturing capacity of the automotive and semiconductor industries in the United States and South Korea. Collected and merged existing data between the two industries from various government sources from the two countries. Feature selection was performed to identify salient COVID-19 features that affect trade, production, and manufacturing which was then used to build a forecasting model using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to predict future response to target variables under the change of feature selected variables. <br>

#### Classifying Wild Edible Flowers by Color Segmentation with a Histogram of Oriented Gradients
<i>Analyzed in MATLAB for CSC481: Introduction to Image Processing at DPU </i> | 
                November 2021<br>
[![Read Report](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20PDF-Read%20Report-CBC3E3?logo=Adobe)](pdf/ClassifyingWildEdibleFlowers_Report.pdf)

<br>
Analysis explores the extraction of texture features using a histogram of gradients (HOG) for image classification for wild edible flowers using support vector machines (SMV). The preprocessing involves color segmentation and compares different HOG parameter sizes as well as different flower class sizes to determine the most optimal parameters for model performance and classification. <br>

#### Exploring Gene Expression Features through PCA and Factor Analysis in Breast Cancer Patients 
<i>Analyzed in R for DSC424: Advanced Data Analysis at DPU </i> | 
                June 2021<br>
[![View in GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View%20in%20GitHub-008080?logo=github)](https://github.com/lacodyle/breast_cancer_gene_expression)
[![Read Report](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20PDF-Read%20Report-CBC3E3?logo=Adobe)](pdf/GeneExpressionAnalysis_Report.pdf)
<br><br>
Analysis determines whether breast cancer clinicial features and gene expression features predict patient survival rates. Data was reduced using principal component analysis, factor analysis, and cluster analysis on gene expression features to better understand the predictive value of the model. <br>
