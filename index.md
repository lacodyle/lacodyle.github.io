#### Classifying Wild Edible Flowers by Color Segmentation and Histogram of Oriented Gradients
<i>Analyzed in MATLAB for CSC481: Intro to Image Processing at DPU       </i> | 
                November 2021<br>

<br>
This analysis explores the extraction of texture features using histogram of gradients (HOG) for classification of images of wild edible flowers
using support vector machines (SVM). The preprocessing involves color segmentation and compares different HOG parameter sizes as well as different
flower class sizes to determine the most optimal parameters for model performance. <br>

#### Exploring Gene Expression Features through PCA and Factor Analysis in Breast Cancer Patients 
<i>Analyzed in R for DSC424: Advanced Data Analysis at DPU       </i> | 
                June 2021<br>

[![Read Report](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20PDF-Read%20Report-CBC3E3?logo=Adobe)](pdf/GeneExpressionAnalysis_Report.pdf)
<br>
Analysis of breast cancer clincial features and gene expression features to explore their relationship with patient survival rate. In this group project, my focus explored dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis, factor analysis, and cluster analysis on the gene expression features.
